This is from frontend 
frontend sends this data to the backend in form on -JSON-
axios.post("/register", {
  fullName: "HK",
  email: "hk@gmail.com",
  password: "1234"
});

Express doesnt understand json on its own so,
app.use(bodyParser.json());    --->   If request has JSON body, extract it into req.body
This data becomes:
req.body.fullName
req.body.email
req.body.password

Express doesnt understand uploaded files(like png) on its own so,
upload.fields([
  { name: "avatar" },
  { name: "coverImage" }
])

✅ Reads incoming file
✅ Saves it temporarily
✅ Adds it into req.files

we can now use req.files.avatar[0].path
